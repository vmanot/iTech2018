# iTech2018
The winning iOS app for the ITC Infotech iTech 2018 Codeathon.

The goal was to create an iOS app highlighting creative and innovative use-cases for Apple's 3D Touch feature. I took existing multi-touch gestures, such as rotate and zoom, and converted them to single-touch gestures with the help of 3D Touch.
